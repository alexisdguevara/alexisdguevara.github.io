    <p>hey! I'm alexis, a New York-based graphic designer with Ecuadorian roots. though my design journey began accidentally in high school, as a result from me having to choose a branch of technology. it was between computer science, software engineering, or graphic design. guess what I chose. it quickly evolved into my lifelong passion.</p>
    <p>as a product of two vibrant cultures, I try to infuse my work with a rich blend of Ecuadorian artistry and the dynamic energy of New York City, my designs are a celebration of heritage and innovation, aiming to tell compelling stories and connect with audiences on a deeper level.</p>
    <p>from crafting captivating logos and symbols to creating effective marketing materials, products, and packaging designs, I thrive in diverse areas of graphic design. each project excites me as an opportunity to create visually stunning and purposeful experiences that leave a lasting impact.</p>
    <p>one day, I aspire to make my mark on the world of sports design by collaborating with my favorite team, the San Antonio Spurs. seeing my work shine on a Times Square billboard, proudly representing myself, would be a dream come true.</p>
